# Datathon-2023 Fashion Compatibility Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains our team's innovative approaches to the Fashion Compatibility Challenge presented by Mango at the Datathon 2023. We leverage data analysis and AI to predict harmonious clothing combinations, offering a unique intersection of fashion and technology.

## Repository Structure
- `CNN_Siamese_Model/`: Siamese CNN model for pairwise product matching prediction.
- `Graph_Model/`: Graph-based model to capture the complex relationships between fashion items.
- `Tabular_Model/`: Features extracted from "product_data.csv" for tabular modeling.

## Results
We explored three different models to tackle fashion compatibility:
- The graph model showed promise, achieving a high AUC score, indicative of good generalization.
- The tabular model utilized features from product data but faced challenges in predicting the compatibility score.
- The Siamese model attempted to predict matching scores based on product image pairs.

For detailed methodology, results, and future improvement plans, refer to our comprehensive [documentation](https://github.com/joansaurina/Datathon-2023/blob/main/datathon.pdf).
